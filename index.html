      <hr class="line2"><br>
                    <p>I am a total nerd who loves video games, anime and manga. I own a large video game collection and started a youtube channel that quickly partnered in 2008. Trading card games are another passion and in 2013 I was the pokemon TCG provincial champion.
                    </p> 
                    <p>I always get asked the question what's your favourite video game of all time? It's nearly impossible to choose just one but some of the series I love include Dragon Quest, Animal Crossing, Monster Hunter, Taiko Drum Master, Pokemon and Splatoon. I am always up for a great Mario game too.
                    </p>
                    <p>My biggest accomplishment in life is my marriage. This february we will be celebrating our 12 year wedding anniversary.
                    </p>   
                    <p>I decidced to make a total life change in 2019. I quit my job and went back to school. I wanted to make a carrer change and I wanted a challenge.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have spend most of my life helping animals and in the process I paid to set up a website for an animal rescuse. The developer I hired did a good job initally but has left the site to fall apart. I found myself so frustraited to not have ther skills to fix it.
                    </p> 
                    <p>Well that brings us to today and my second assignment. This is a responsive page built off of my wireframe site but using Bootstrap. I customized it so it matched the theme of my original. What do you think?
